# My Social Platforms - Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website, which serves as a landing page to showcase and provide links to my active social platforms. The website is designed to be responsive and optimized for mobile devices, ensuring efficient display on various screen sizes. However, it may not provide an optimal viewing experience on larger screens.

## Technologies and Languages Used

The website is built using the following technologies and languages:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Used for structuring and organizing the content of the website.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Responsible for styling and layout, including colors, fonts, backgrounds, and positioning of elements.
- JavaScript: Enhances interactivity and user experience, enabling dynamic functionalities such as showing/hiding elements and handling events.
- Responsive Design: The website is designed with a responsive approach, ensuring it adapts and functions well on mobile devices. Media queries and flexible layouts are utilized.
- Social Media Integration: The main purpose of the website is to provide easy access to my active social platforms. Each platform is represented by a menu item with an associated icon, allowing visitors to navigate to my LinkedIn, Medium, and GitHub profiles.

## Usage

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The website can be accessed on both mobile devices and larger screens. However, please note that the display may not be optimal on larger screens, although the content and functionality will still be accessible.
